                    <P>Though I didn't use my coding skills directly to bring this site to life, it was my first projects as the Creative Director of a coaching collective of which I am a part. I designed the branding and style of what we wanted to present and made this site on my own. It was a labor of love and passion. It helped me further understand my growing skillset within a different context.</P>

                    <p>This project was a massive undertaking. It was my second project as a student of coding and it felt a lot like being thrown in the deep end of the pool after reading a book about how to swim. To say I was proud when I completed it is an understatement of epic proportions. The thing is, I actually LOVED doing it too! That's when I knew coding was for me.</p>

                 <p>I didn't consider myself to be the "type of person who could code" until recently. When I started to imagine the possibilities of being in a constant state of problem solving and discovery, I was hooked on the idea. As a coach by trade and professional idea creator by hobby, this felt like the exact compliment to everything I love doing in life. It's creativity, challenge, and nerdiness at it's best. </p>
